# Title: Interactive Map of Migratory Birds Distribution
# Detail: Proposal Create an interactive map of migratory birds distribution pattern with with an integration of shiny and leaflet. Users can use the maps to locate a spot on the map and identify the total number of species of migratory birds within that region. Other information, including the human impacts(from human settlement development), will also be presented to represent the different level of human impacts on the intactness of the migratory birds' habitat. This will utilize the data package I created fro AAG 2017. I will also need to learn more about visualization tools in R and Java.
